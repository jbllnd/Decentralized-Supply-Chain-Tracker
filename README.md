# 🌿 Decentralized Supply Chain Tracker

Welcome to a revolutionary way to ensure transparency and authenticity in global supply chains using the Stacks blockchain! This project addresses real-world issues like counterfeit goods, unethical sourcing, and inefficient tracking by providing an immutable, decentralized ledger for product journeys from origin to consumer.

## ✨ Features

📦 Register products with unique identifiers  
🔄 Log supply chain milestones (e.g., harvesting, manufacturing, shipping)  
🔒 Secure ownership transfers between parties  
✅ Verify product authenticity and history instantly  
🚨 Manage product recalls with automated notifications  
🏆 Incentive system for compliant suppliers via tokens  
📊 Analytics dashboard for chain efficiency  
🛡️ Dispute resolution for supply issues  

## 🛠 How It Works

This project leverages 8 smart contracts written in Clarity to create a robust, tamper-proof system. Here's a high-level overview:

### Smart Contracts Overview
1. **SupplierRegistry.clar**: Handles registration and verification of suppliers, ensuring only vetted entities participate.  
2. **ProductRegistry.clar**: Allows creation of new product entries with unique hashes and metadata.  
3. **MilestoneLogger.clar**: Records immutable timestamps and details for each supply chain step.  
4. **OwnershipTransfer.clar**: Facilitates secure transfers of product ownership with signatures.  
5. **AuthenticityVerifier.clar**: Provides functions to query and confirm a product's full history.  
6. **RecallManager.clar**: Triggers recalls, notifies stakeholders, and tracks resolutions.  
7. **IncentiveToken.clar**: Manages staking and rewards for ethical practices using a custom token.  
8. **DisputeResolver.clar**: Enables arbitration for disputes with voting mechanisms from stakeholders.

**For Suppliers/Manufacturers**  
- Register your entity using SupplierRegistry.  
- Create a product entry via ProductRegistry with details like origin and batch info.  
- Log each milestone (e.g., "harvested on date X") using MilestoneLogger.  
- Transfer ownership to the next party with OwnershipTransfer.  

**For Distributors/Retailers**  
- Verify incoming products with AuthenticityVerifier to check history.  
- Log your handling steps and transfer ownership downstream.  
- Stake tokens in IncentiveToken to build reputation and earn rewards for compliance.  

**For Consumers/Regulators**  
- Scan a product ID to view its full chain via AuthenticityVerifier.  
- Report issues to initiate DisputeResolver.  
- In case of recalls, get notified through RecallManager.  

That's it! End-to-end transparency that builds trust and reduces fraud.

Immutable policy tracking to monitor implementation progress.
